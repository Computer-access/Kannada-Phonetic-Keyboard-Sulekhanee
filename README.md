# Kannada Phonetic Keyboard Sulekhanee

 The phonetic keyboard to typing Kannada in any application.

This keyboard is extremely helpful for typing Kannada very faster in any application. This keyboard is created by an application called Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator. in this keyboard the keys are combined with the letters like the key combinations of the 'Kagapa Nudi Kannada keyboard'. However, there are some limitations in the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator where the letters are not mapped to keys as fully as the Nudi keyboard. But the keyboard of Nudi application does not work properly in applications like Microsoft word, Microsoft excel. Therefore, this keyboard is built because there is a need for a keyboard that is convenient for typing Kannada faster and easily in all applications and is easily accessible everywhere. Modifications will be made in this keyboard in future as per user convenience.
